# PostRobot2019

A Complete Rewrite Of Robot Code

Designed to be scalable and easily changed

## Structure

The code is organized into differnt packages that all have specific uses

The direct robot code is put into the ``` frc.team4550.robot ``` package.

Basic piping and everything that can be reused, and dosen't have direct ties
to the robot code, will go into other packages

This allows us to keep everything nice and tidy AND keep code that dosn't need
to be connected to the robot away from it.
